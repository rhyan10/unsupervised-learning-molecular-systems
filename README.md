# Unsupervised learning for molecular systems - best practices
CECAM Workshop, Vienna, 2023

# Walk-through examples (good and bad examples)
## Example 1: Feature selection
1. Illustrate with 2D representation, 3D representation, and MD trajectories (3 examples of increasing complexity).
## Example 2: Dimensionality reduction
1. Use same examples as above.
## Example 3: Generative modeling
1. Training an autoencoder on SMILES from QM9.
2. Searching latent space for molecules with high DRD2 activity.
3. Point to relevant works in the literature for 3D and perhaps MD applications of generative modeling (but this cannot be here as those tasks are too complex to run in a laptop).

# Datasets
QM9, MD22
