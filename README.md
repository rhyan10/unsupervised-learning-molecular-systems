## Datasets
### QM7
The QM7 dataset to be used in the examples below is available in [data/qm7.xyz](./data/qm7.xyz). Data was downloaded from blah blah blah and processed according to blah blah.

It includes SMILES strings, 3D coordinates, and blah blah quantum properties.

The original data is available on [this page](http://quantum-machine.org/datasets/).

## Example 1: Representations and Descriptors
[Walk-through](./1-Representations-and-Descriptors/1-Tutorial.ipynb)
1. Illustrate with 2D representation, 3D representation, and MD trajectories (3 examples of increasing complexity).

## Example 2: Dimensionality reduction
[Walk-through](./2-Dimensionality-Reduction/2-Tutorial.ipynb)
1. Use same examples as above.
